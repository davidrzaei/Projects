Introduction
The Image to PDF Converter is a web application designed to facilitate the conversion of images into PDF documents. This readme provides an overview of the application's structure, functionality, deployment instructions, and additional considerations for maintenance and usage.

Application Structure
The application consists of the following components:

Frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript):

index.html: Provides the user interface for uploading images, selecting conversion options (single PDF or multiple PDFs), and configuring PDF settings (paper size, orientation, margin, quality).
styles.css: Defines the visual styling of the interface, ensuring responsiveness and usability across different devices and screen sizes.
JavaScript: Enhances user interaction by dynamically updating options based on user input (e.g., displaying conversion type options).
Backend (Python with Flask):

app.py: Implements the server-side logic using Flask framework. Handles file uploads, processes image-to-PDF conversion based on user-selected options, and manages file storage and retrieval.
PIL (Python Imaging Library): Used for image manipulation and PDF generation.
Dependencies:

Flask: Web framework for Python.
PIL (Pillow): Python Imaging Library for image processing.
Other standard Python libraries for file operations and zip handling.
Functionality
Uploading and Conversion
Users can upload one or multiple images.
Depending on the number of images uploaded, users can choose between converting them into a single PDF document or multiple separate PDFs.
Conversion options include specifying paper size (e.g., A4, Letter), orientation (portrait or landscape), margin size, and PDF quality.
Handling of Uploaded Files
Uploaded images are temporarily stored in the 'uploads' directory.
Converted PDFs are saved in the 'converted' directory.
For multiple image uploads, a zip file containing individual PDFs is created for download.
User Interface
Responsive design ensures usability on various devices.
Clear instructions and intuitive controls guide users through the conversion process.
Styling provides a clean and professional look, enhancing user experience.
Deployment
To deploy the Image to PDF Converter:

Setup Environment:

Install Python and Flask on your server or local environment.
Ensure necessary Python libraries (Pillow, Flask) are installed.
Clone Repository:

Clone the application repository from the source.
Configure Directories:

Create 'uploads' and 'converted' directories in the root directory of the application with appropriate permissions.
Run Application:

Execute python app.py to start the Flask server.
Access the application through a web browser using the provided URL (usually http://localhost:5000).
Additional Considerations
Security:

Implement file type validation and size limits to prevent malicious uploads.
Use secure practices for handling file paths and user inputs.
Performance:

Optimize image processing and PDF generation algorithms for performance efficiency, especially with large files.
Error Handling:

Implement robust error handling and user feedback mechanisms to handle edge cases and unexpected behaviors.
Scaling:

Consider scalability options for handling increased traffic or larger file volumes.
Utilize cloud storage solutions for handling files in distributed environments.
