sort1 uses: Bubble sort

How do you know?:
Random and Reversed takes roughly the same time,
but when going through already sorted, the timing becomes significantly lower.

sort2 uses: Merge sort

How do you know?:
It used roughly the same time to sort random, reversed, and already sorted numbers.
It also generaly uses the least amount of time to do it.

sort3 uses: Selection sort

How do you know?:
All three sortings takes roughly the same time, which would indicating
(like merge) that it goes through a predetermined amount of steps from start-end.
However, as it comes out with timing higher than sort 2,
odds are that it is using Selection sorting rather than merge.
