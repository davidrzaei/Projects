If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

One way that we can calculate the auora of the playlist creator based of the avg of ex. energy, dancability, and tempo.
These three parementers seems reasonable to use, as they per design indicate whether or not a song is dancable, and whether or not the energy and tempo is high or low.
A song which is high energy, high tempo, and dancable might indicate a song which was made for ex. a club enviroment, whereas a song which might have a low energy, mid tempo, but high danacability may indicate a song used in ex. a slow dance.
Given the avg of these tree paremeters, the creator of the playlist should be someone likes a bit more energy, a decent amount of tempo, and likes to dance.
We might insinuate that the creator of the playlist might be a 20-25 year old college student based on this.




Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener.
What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?

Where this calculation takes a wrong turn is the use of avg.
If we look a bit closer, we can see that most of the paremeters have a wide spand below and above their avg.
As such, the avg of these does not offer any real information about the reasoning that might have been behind the songs inclussion.

A way to get a bit closer to something usable, might be to querry about the amount of song that have ex. a tempo above 119.
This would perhaps offer a better view of how much "club" music is actually present, rather that assume that the avg is a credible indication thereof.
Ex. a playlist with 30/100 song with a tempo of 190, wheras the other 70/100 has a tempo of 60 would avg with a tempo of 102. A number which would neither indicate one or the other tempo correctly to an analyst.

One might even make a group of ex. low tempo, mid tempo, and high tempo, and then further group these into ex. low, mid, and high energy, etc.
From here, we might be able to tell some actual info about the creator of the playlist that, at least largy, isn't perfunctory or superficial.

Data used:
avg energy = 0.65096
avg danceability = 0.71646
avg loudness = -5.67764
avg valence = 0.484443
avg tempo = 119.90418
